Warning!
The program is still in early alpha stage and is highly possible
that it would make your palm unstable. Think twice before
installing the binary to a real palm.


This is a minimal read me file for the FEdit application
for the Palm OS platform.

You can directly install the application into the palm, using
the provided prc file.

The left number on the screen is the width of the current font
and the left is the current ASCII character being edited.

The right icon displays the current drawing mode:
1) Draw
2) Erase
3) Smart draw: if the first square was filled, is used as an
   eraser, or else as a drawing pen.


You can save the font giving it any name you like. The "slot"
represents a unique character for every unique font, that is
desired to appear simultaneously. Special care has been taken
in order the program to be compatible with the FontHack123
hack.



Known bugs & limitations:
=========================

- The last character is not saved. To save it simply navigate to
  the next chracter (which becomes the current "last" character).

- The font is always saved as fixed size (?)

- The default height of the font is not able to change (although
  it is possible to recompile the source code and alter the
  default height)


Future issues:
==============

- Create dialog to define the desired default height

- Display the new character on screen (real time) with it's real
  height

- Display the original character on screen

- Buttons to move the glyph to all 4 directions

- Test screen with all the drawn fonts

- Load font from memory
